1. Difference between static and sealed class?

Static class
---cannot be instantiated or inherited
---ccan have static members only
---cstatic constructor
---csealed, means one cannot interit a static class from another class

Sealed class
---ccan be instantiated but cannot be inherited.

2. What is static method?
---ccan be called without creating an object.
---ccannot call static methods using an object of the non-static class.
---ccan only call other static methods and access static members.
---ccannot access non-static members of the class in the static methods.

3. What is static variable?
---cWhen a variable is declared as static, then a single copy of the variable is created and shared among all objects at a class level.
---cAll instances of the class share the same static variable.
---cStatic variables can be accessed using class name
---cStatic variables can be accessed by static and non static methods
---cStatic variables can be accessed using class name.
---cStatic variables reduce the amount of memory used by a program.
