1. Difference between static and sealed class?

Static class
---cannot be instantiated or inherited
---can have static members only
---static constructor
---sealed, means one cannot interit a static class from another class

Sealed class
---can be instantiated but cannot be inherited.
---can have static and non-static members

2. What is static method?
---can be called without creating an object.
---cannot call static methods using an object of the non-static class.
---can only call other static methods and access static members.
---cannot access non-static members of the class in the static methods.

3. What is static variable?
---When a variable is declared as static, then a single copy of the variable is created and shared among all objects at a class level.
---All instances of the class share the same static variable.
---Static variables can be accessed using class name
---Static variables can be accessed by static and non static methods
---Static variables can be accessed using class name.
---Static variables reduce the amount of memory used by a program.
